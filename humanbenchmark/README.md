Math.

----------------------To work the User Interface------------------------------

Just follow the text and explainations given found on the buttons and in the 
various labels and Texts. I think it is pretty easy to use, very self
explainatory.


---------------------------------Bugs-----------------------------------------
None known, but I maybe if you really start stressing the buttons, like just
clicking the buttons on the pages other than Home Page really fast and clicking
them when the game does not seem to be implying it is time to click said 
buttons, it may bug out. But still, maybe not.
